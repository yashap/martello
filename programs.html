              "<h3>Math</h3>
              <p class='lead program-details'>Martello’s mathematics program begins at the Jr. Kindergarten level focusing on manipula- tives, meaning use of numbers in adding and subtracting up to 25, working with number placements,and basic rules of math. By the time the student enters grade 1, they can add and subtract in their head up to 25 and work on multiplication. Using both traditional by rote learn- ing and use of cd of math put to music helps younger children particularly master these first mathematical concepts and they are often heard singing multiplication tables as they go about their day.</p>
              <p class='lead program-details'>We like to stress the basics and ensure our students have a solid foundation in the four basic functions of math before they move on to more complex concepts. Following the Ontario cur- riculum and incorporating Martello’s philosophy, our students in grade 1 are regularly working with concepts the public system follows in grade 3. Students are also introduced to problem solving, both functional and word based, where they determine the correct mathematical func- tion to use to reach an answer.</p>
              <p class='lead program-details'>As our students move through the grade structure they are introduced to more complex con- cepts and problems. Two of our teaching staff are experts in math and are available to assist students who need extra work in this area. Math is both a fascinating and necessary skill, and Martello students enjoy both their studies and the achievements they make.</p>
              <p class='lead program-details'>Every year for over the past 15 years Grades 3-6 participate in a Canada-wide mathematics con- test “ Mathematica” . Each grade does a separate test with special names: Grade 3 do “Thales”; Grade 4 “Fibonacci”; Grade 5 “Byron-Germain” ; Grade 6 “ Pythagoras:” The children enjoy these competitions immensely and we have won medals every year we’ve participated and are in the “top” percent from all across Canada!<p class='lead program-details'>">Math</button>
            <button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" role="button" data-feature=
              "<h3>Science</h3>
              <p class='lead program-details'>Martello children are introduced to the wonderful world of science as early as Jr. Kindergarten beginning with the basic facts: earth, air, fire and water. Studies in the junior grades work in a hands-on manner noting facts and doing experiments on simple topics such as dinosaurs or aquatic life. As they move through the grade levels work becomes gradually more complex touching on structures, machinery and the scientific process.</p>
              <p class='lead program-details'>In addition, students in the grade 4/5/6 levels participate in the Martello Science Fair where they choose a particular science problem that they solve on boards and display to the class. Grade 5 and 6 students also take part in the regional science fair where they compete against students across the country. A number of Martello students have been awarded medals at this level.</p>
              <p class='lead program-details'>The program is rounded out with special events such as field trips to study pond life, apple picking and learning how to turn the harvest into applesauce and visits from Queen’s Science Quests are always looked forward to by students.</p>">Science</button>

              "<h3>History</h3>
              <p class='lead program-details'>History classes at the lower level are combined with geography and classified as thematic Social Studies. It begins as early as JK with simple mapping and environment studies around themes; anything from “Our Neighbourhood” to “ pioneer” to “what’s happening in the world”.</p>
              <p class='lead program-details'>These thematic studies continue as far as grade 4. After that the subjects split into history and geography. (check these Ontario curriculums on line). Students at this level are introduced to Canadian history beginning with local studies of the Kingston area and onwards into provincial, national views, world history, social economics and Canada’s place within the world.</p>
              <p class='lead program-details'>Kingston is a rich historical area and Martello capitalizes on this throughout the program partici- pating in visits to Fort Henry and going on local archlogical digs. A number of students regu- larly participate in the Kingston Historic Fair which requires research on a local area. Two of our students created a beautiful model of Martello Tower supported by historical research and won a bronze medal in the last fair.Teachers enrich these programs with guest speakers, local visits and trips outside the city.</p>">History</button>

              "<h3>English</h3>
              <p class='lead program-details'>The language program begins in Jr. Kindergarten level with a phonics program. The method is very tactile to help the child learn the shape and sound of the letters before they begin putting letters together and reading short vowel words so that by Sr. Kindergarten they are reading long vowels. Whatever grade a child begins at, their level is assessed in order to individualize their program so that strengths can be supported and weak areas developed. By grade 1 students are generally reading and printing from the board and the basics of grammar are introduced be- ginning with action verbs and how to make a sentence from a verb. This leads to printing and composing sentences, followed by the introduction of nouns and composing sentences with both nouns and verbs. In grade 3 we delve into adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions and how the parts of speech work together.</p>
              <p class='lead program-details'>From grade 1 onward we also focus on spelling; children work within their basic vocabulary around a theme, such as Thanksgiving, and are given 10 words drawn from that them for each week’s lesson Grade 2 takes that a step further into memorization and begins an introduction to composition where students are required to write a story on a particular theme which is then edited by a teacher prior to a final corrected copy being produced by the student.</p>
              <p class='lead program-details'>In grades 2 and 3 students do simple novel studies reading in a group with a teacher which helps the children become comfortable speaking within a group. By the time a student enters the 4/5/6/ level they are working on more complex novels, intricate grammar rules along with oral and written comprehension. Additionally throughout the grade structure students are required to choose a topic and do a presentation on that topic, with the level of difficulty increasing in the higher grades.</p>">English</button>
